## Introduction
The integration of high penetration of renewable generation into  power  systems  calls  for  a  growing  need  to  model  the uncertain  and  intermittent characteristics of these resources. An  important  method  used  in  characterizing  the  behavior  of renewable  resources  is scenario  generation,  where a set of possible future realizations are provided for the system opera-
tor. Compared to deterministic point forecasts or probabilistic forecasts, scenario forecasts could not only inform users of the uncertainty about the future, but also reflect the temporal dependence  of  renewable  power  generation

## Methods
We combine the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for scenario generation, as well as an optimization step based on specific-designed loss to make forecasts based on historical observations.
